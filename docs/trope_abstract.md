# 📄 **Trope DSL: Abstract**

---

## 🔍 Introduction

**Trope DSL** is a structural language designed to represent abstract entities such as software modules, services, systems, or even physical objects. Its purpose is to offer a clear, semantically rich syntax that allows humans and machines to describe, validate, and generate complex structures — whether for analysis, simulation, or automated development.

The system builds on:

- A formally defined grammar in EBNF  
- A semantic schema in JSON (`trope.schema.json`)  
- Contextual generation support via AI tools

---

## 🧩 General Intent

### 1. **Structured Object Description**
Though born from software modeling, Trope DSL is designed to describe _any_ structured object through blocks, properties, relationships, and behaviors.

Examples:
- A backend service (`AuthService`)
- A physical robot with sensors (`PhysicProps`)
- An educational concept (`LogicProps`, `Methods`)
- A software architecture pattern (`designPattern`)

### 2. **Modular System Structuring**
Trope enables the division of a complex system into modular, communicable entities. These can be understood and manipulated by an AI without needing the entire system in memory. This unlocks:

- Directed contextualization  
- Cross-module interoperability  
- Incremental generative workflows

### 3. **Facilitating Human–AI Collaboration**
Through descriptors (`.dscr`) and metamodels, Trope encapsulates knowledge in a form that AI systems can interpret, enrich, and transform. The goals include:

- Simplifying intent articulation  
- Formalizing abstract design  
- Activating emergent structural reasoning in AI systems

## 🔧 EBNF Elements and Their Purpose

| Block                  | Purpose                                                                 |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Document`             | Groups a collection of entities under one file or context               |
| `Entity`               | Primary unit of description — service, class, physical or conceptual    |
| `DocComment`           | Defines the general purpose or documentation string                     |
| `AliasBlock`           | Alternate name for cross-language or cross-system recognition           |
| `ImportBlock` / `ExtendsBlock` / `MixinsBlock` | Declares dependency, inheritance, or behavioral composition |
| `IdPropsBlock`         | Identity-level attributes (author, category, tags, etc.)                |
| `PhysicPropsBlock`     | Physical characteristics (for robotics, simulation, IoT, etc.)          |
| `LogicPropsBlock`      | Internal logical states or behavioral flags                             |
| `SecurityPropsBlock`   | Security-related declarations — access control, encryption              |
| `ClassesBlock`         | Internal categorical types (e.g. `Administrator`, `Guest`)              |
| `DataModelBlock`       | Defines structured data models used by the entity                       |
| `MethodsBlock`         | Declares behaviors, capabilities, and callable logic                    |
| `Metadata`             | Rich meta-definitions: design patterns, security levels, semantic hints |

## 🧠 Role of Design Patterns

The explicit inclusion of `DesignPatterns` inside `Metadata` allows the AI (or other agents) to recognize, extrapolate, and reinforce known design principles:

Examples:
- `Observer`: Suggests event-based interactions and subscribers  
- `FactoryMethod`: Hints at `createX(...)` constructors  
- Trope acts as a **semantic design canvas**, enabling emergent modeling

---

## 🧬 Semantic Structure and JSON Schema

The `trope.schema.json` file enables machine-level semantic validation:

- Declares data types, block structures, and rules  
- Guarantees consistency across entities and models  
- Powers auto-validation in editors or processing tools

---

## 📣 Future Considerations

### 🔹 **Context Modularity**
Trope emphasizes passing only the relevant descriptors to let a system (such as an LLM) grasp the active context — without needing the entire system’s history.

> This enables segmental generation, targeted inference, and scalable design interaction.

### 🔹 **Model Parameters**
A future addition could introduce a `LLMParams` block to define:

- `temperature`, `top_p`, `max_tokens`  
- Escape characters, stop sequences, disallowed tokens  
- Minimum certainty thresholds for generative validation

### 🔹 **Token Confidence & Probabilistic Structuring**
An experimental mode could track the likelihood of generated tokens and use it to decide:

- Whether additional context is required  
- Whether generation should pause  
- Whether validation or retry should be triggered automatically
